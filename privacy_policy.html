        <h1>Privacy Policy for RunItUp</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how RunItUp ("the App") collects, uses, and shares information from users. This App is provided by Kory Buck ("the Developer"). Your privacy is important. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Developer Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Kory Buck</li>

        <p>To provide and improve the App's services, RunItUp collects the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> RunItUp collects your precise geolocation data (GPS coordinates) while you are actively using the App to track a run. This is essential for the App's core functionality of mapping your run, calculating distance, and determining pace.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Provided Content:</strong> RunItUp accesses your device's camera roll (photo library) only if you grant permission and choose to upload a profile picture. RunItUp does not access your photos for any other purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How RunItUp Uses Your Information</h2>
        <p>RunItUp uses the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To create your account, track your runs, and display your run history and profile.</li>
            <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> To display your chosen profile picture and map your personal run routes.</li>
            <li><strong>To Secure Your Account:</strong> To verify your identity and protect your account from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> To send you important information about your account or the App, or to respond to your support requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses Firebase, a service provided by Google, for backend services. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> To manage user accounts and store your email address securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Firestore/Firebase Storage:</strong> To store your account data, run history, and profile picture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your information is stored on Firebase servers. By using the App, you acknowledge that your data will be processed and stored by Firebase in accordance with their privacy policy. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>RunItUp does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your data is not shared with any third parties except for the necessary service providers (like Firebase) required for the App to function. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies to not use or disclose your information for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Control and Rights</h2>
        <p>You have control over your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update your profile information (such as your email or profile picture) within the App's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting the Developer directly at korymbuck@gmail.com. Your request will be processed in a timely manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can manage the App's access to your location data and camera roll at any time through your iOS device's settings menu. Please note that disabling these permissions may cause core features of the App to stop working.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>RunItUp takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. All data, such as your email and run history, is stored securely using Firebase's encrypted databases. However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and RunItUp cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. RunItUp does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If RunItUp becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided personal information, RunItUp will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>RunItUp may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's App Store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
